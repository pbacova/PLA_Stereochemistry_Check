Code for calculating the internal distances R_n^2/n of PLA chains.
The input file contains unwrapped coordinates (x,y,z) in Gromacs format (gro) without velocities. 
It includes "nchain" linear chains, each with "lchain" atoms. The itp file 100LA.itp illustrates the order of the atoms in the gro file (i.e., 100-mer PLA contains 903 atoms) as also reported in doi:10.1021/ct200251x.
